# MMA-Tests Code Cleanup and Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. **Added `CommonSelectors.cs` Class**
   - Centralized common selectors used across page objects
   - Defined standard button text arrays for consistent element identification
   - Reduced selector duplication

2. **Improved `BasePage.cs`**
   - Added common helper methods for element interaction
   - Created shared navigation and UI methods
   - Implemented standardized form interaction helpers
   - Added common validation methods
   - Centralized debugging methods

3. **Streamlined `BaseTest.cs`**
   - Removed duplication with BasePage
   - Added URL comparison helper methods
   - Improved documentation

4. **Refactored Page Objects**
   - Updated `LoginPage.cs` to use common methods
   - Simplified `PatientDashboardPage.cs`
   - Improved `DoctorDashboardPage.cs` with consolidated selectors
   - Streamlined `ApothecaryDashboardPage.cs`

5. **Enhanced Test Classes**
   - Updated `LoginTests.cs` and `ApothecaryTests.cs` to use improved page objects
   - Removed direct WebDriver access in favor of page object methods
   - Improved readability with clearer arrange-act-assert sections

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Eliminated duplicate methods for common operations
   - Centralized selectors and UI patterns

2. **Page Object Pattern Improvements**
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - More consistent method signatures
   - Better encapsulation of WebDriver interactions

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added multiple fallback strategies
   - Improved logging for diagnostics
   - More resilient element finding

4. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - Standardized method names
   - Improved parameter naming
   - Better XML documentation

5. **Simplified Test Structure**
   - Clearer arrange-act-assert sections
   - Reduced direct WebDriver manipulation in tests
   - More focused test methods

## Future Recommendations

1. **Move Constants to Configuration**
   - Consider moving test user credentials to WebDriverConfig

2. **Add Fluent Assertions**
   - Consider using a fluent assertion library for more readable assertions

3. **Implement Parallel Test Execution**
   - Current tests can be made thread-safe for parallel execution

4. **Add More Test Categories**
   - Tag tests with attributes for selective execution

5. **Consider API-Based Test Setup**
   - Use API calls where possible for test data setup instead of UI interactions
